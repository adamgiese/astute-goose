As someone who has always been inconsistent in the output of writing, I'm finding writing a first blog post to be incredibly difficult. Like many board games, there isn't an obvious first move. Should I jump right into a review, post an introduction about myself, or start with philosophizing about why board games are such a great art form?

I'll start by answering a question that I had for myself: why? What is the purpose of another online blog? What can I give that isn't already covered? Who cares what _you_ think?

There are a few reasons **why**. First, because I believe that a wide variety of voices from different backgrounds and tastes help to ensure that the hobby avoids becoming an echo chamber. While my tastes will certainly not align with everyone's, they'll hopefully align _very well_ to someone! That _someone_, if they find this blog, will hopefully care what I think. 

Lastly, I believe there is something else unique that I can provide. I'm a software developer by trade -- and I believe that there are lots of great opportunities for "micro-apps" that can be used to find a perfect game. Rather than having _just_ another **Top 10 Party Games** list, perhaps I can build an interactive **Find the Right Party Game for _You_** application.

I'm hoping that this is the beginning of a long journey. Happy gaming!
