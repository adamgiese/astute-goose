This is the first **Original Design** of Game Ideas! I hope to continually write game ideas here, and would love to get any feedback on any of the games! 

## Intent for Exact Change

**Exact Change** is ***heavily*** inspired by the delightful **DroPolter.** I am a *huge* fan of what I affectionately call “silly little dexterity games,” and this game checks all of those boxes. You can view the full rules on [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/405537/dropolter), but the super-short version - a card gets flipped, and you need to drop from your hand the matching items.

Another intent of **Exact Change** has a bit more personal history. I have two young daughters (as of the time of writing, 5 & 8), each of whom is a good sport about going into the local game stores with me while I browse. Although they have no experience with any tabletop RPGs, they are always drawn to the beautiful polyhedral dice, so we have slowly but surely started a modest collection. Since we have so many of these polyhedral dice without many games that use them, I was hoping to create some fun, family weight games to make sure that make use of these dice. 

## Rules

### Components

*The exact component list is dependent on local currency. The provided currency is for the United States, but it can be adapted to any currency.*

- A set of percentile dice
- An identical set of coins for each player, ensuring that all values from 1 to 99 are achievable with the coins. For example, in the US you would need 4 pennies, 3 quarters, 2 dimes, and 1 nickel for each player.
- A unique coin that stands out from the rest: for example, a 50 cent or dollar coin.
- A “trophy” - something to place in the middle for everybody to grab.

### Setup

1. Place the trophy, unique coin, and percentile dice in the middle of the table.
2. Give everybody their set of coins. 

### Gameplay

- Someone rolls the dice, and loudly says the number. In the 1% chance that you roll a double zero, re-roll.
- Simultaneously, everybody drops coins from their hand to total the amount shown on the dice. If you drop too many coins, or coins such that you can no longer make the amount, you are out of the round.
- The first person to drop all of the coins grabs the trophy. Validate that they have dropped the correct amount. If so, they win the unique coin, which they must hold in their hand. If the unique coin is already held by someone, they must give it to you.
- If nobody wins a round, return the unique coin to the center.
- Repeat the previous steps. If at any point somebody wins while already owning the unique coin, they win the game!
