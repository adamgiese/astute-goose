## Game Overview

**Flip 7** is a push-your-luck card game with very simple rules. Everybody is dealt a card, and you can choose to either bank your points or risk pulling another card. If you take another card and it is unique in your row, congratulations - you add its points to your round's total! If it matches another in your row, however, you bust. You lose *all* of your points from the round, and are eliminated until the next round.

There are a few other things worth mentioning: the card distribution consists of one 1, two 2s, three 3s, etc., up to twelve 12s. So, the lower value cards are worth less, *and* less likely to make you bust. In addition, there is a "0" value card — because if you *flip seven* cards without busting, you get a bonus 15 points for the round. There are also some unique cards, like free points that don’t have any duplicates, and some special ability cards that you can read about in detail in the rulebook.

## What I Love & What I Don’t About Flip 7

There are a lot of things that **Flip 7** does right. The game’s straightforward rules make it very accessible - you can teach the basics in under a minute. There are a few edge cases around the special ability cards, but overall it is very easy to teach. The fact that the card distribution is easy to understand also means that players are able to quickly make informed decisions. The inviting nature of the game is furthered by the beautiful art deco illustrations. The artwork just *invites* you to align your cards in a perfect row.

On the flip side, there are some frustrating aspects. I embrace swings of luck in a push-your-luck game, but the fact that you are *eliminated* from the rounds when busting leads to significant downtime, especially in larger player counts. The game boasts no upper limit in its advertised player count. Seriously — the box just says 3+, and the rulebook suggests a second copy if you play with 18 or more players, which sounds like a frankly mind-numbing affair. 

## Does Flip 7 Belong in *Your* Collection?

I've had some fun playing **Flip 7**. With the right group: 4-5 players, all who play quickly to avoid anybody being out of the game _too_ long, I think the game can really work. In many cases, though, I think there are better options available. For example, if you are looking for a game that checks a lot of the same boxes as **Flip 7**, take a look at the newly reprinted **Fruit Fight**. Designed by Dr. Reiner Knizia and produced by **CMYK Games**, the rules are even simpler without sacrificing interesting decisions, and the push-your-luck element is less punishing without sacrificing tension.
