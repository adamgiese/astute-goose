As I mentioned in my [previous post](/blog/party-games) about party games, I don't agree with the BoardGameGeek definition of "party games." In this follow-up post, I'll be going over the Top 10 "Party" games according to BGG, and discussing whether I think they fit my definition of a party game. You can read the whole post if you'd like, but the three parts of a party games by my definition are a **flexible player count**, **easy to learn**, and **a round that is more important than the game** (or a very short game). 


## Decrypto

In **Decrypto,** teams try to send and decode messages using a set of secret words, without letting the opposing team figure out the code.

**Decrypto** is *moderately* flexible in player count, and *fairly* easy to teach. Where it fails most as a party game, though, is the need for careful strategy and longer gameplay times make it feel more like a team puzzle game than a party game. This longer and strategic game prevents players from easily coming in and out. 

**Verdict:** _Not_ a party game.

## Codenames

In **Codenames**, teams compete to uncover their words on a grid using single-word clues from their spymaster, while avoiding their opponents words and especially the assassin word.

The description of **Decrypto** above could be written almost identically for **Codename.** It fits well on the player counter & ease of teach, but a satisfying unit of play is too long to allow players for coming and going. 

**Verdict:** _Not_ a party game.

## Just One

In **Just One**, players cooperatively give one-word clues to help someone guess a secret word, but identical clues cancel out.

**Just One** is a perfect example of a party game. It’s extremely flexible in player count, the rules are simple enough to teach in under a minute, and it’s played in quick, independent rounds.

## Blood on the Clocktower**

**Blood on the Clocktower** is a social deduction game where players, divided into good and evil teams, attempt to discover the demon among them through discussion, bluffing, and the use of special abilities. 

**Blood on the Clocktower** is designed for large groups (5-20 players in _theory_), but the rules are quite complex, and also require a dedicated storyteller. The game is also too long to be a party game, sometimes lasting multiple hours. 

---

**The Resistance: Avalon** and **Secret Hitler**

In **The Resistance: Avalon,** players are knights of King Arthur's court, some loyal while others are secretly serving Mordred. Succeed or sabotage enough missions to win. In **Secret Hitler,** players work to pass laws, with liberals trying to prevent fascists from secretly placing Hitler in power.

Each of these games are pretty prototypical example of social deduction. Like **Blood on the Clocktower,** it is flexible on player count. Unlike **Blood on the Clocktower,** the rulesets are quite straightforward. The *main* reason that social deductions in general don’t fit my definition of a “party game” is that the games work only if you have a steady group, and you can’t have people jumping in and out.

**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong**

In **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong,** players are investigators trying to figure out the murderer among them through clues provided by a silent forensic scientist. The game has many similarities to **Codenames** mixed with a social deduction like **The Resistance.** The player count is flexible and the rules are simple: but the game can’t be played in isolation.

**Verdict:** Not a party game.

**Sushi Go: Party**

In **Sushi Go: Party,** players draft sushi cards to create high-scoring combinations over a series of rounds. Yet another case where the player count is flexible, the rules are simple, but the game doesn't lend itself well to players dropping in and out mid-game. The card drafting mechanic requires a consistent player count throughout, and the scoring system builds over multiple rounds.

**Verdict:** Despite its name, *not a party game.*

---

**Monikers**

In **Monikers,** players describe, act out, or use one word to help their team guess a set of  names over three increasingly challenging rounds. It works for large groups and can scale easily, and the rules are intuitive and quick to explain. Each round builds on the previous one, which makes it a bit difficult to jump into the middle, but the game is short enough. 

---

**Dixit**

- **How to play**: Players provide creative descriptions for surreal images in an attempt to have some but not all players guess their card.
- **Party game characteristics**: Dixit supports a moderate player count (3-6 players) and is reasonably flexible, but it falls short of being a true party game. While the rules are easy to grasp, the game tends to encourage quiet contemplation and creativity rather than fast-paced social interaction. The game’s slower rounds and reliance on thoughtful clue-giving make it feel more like a creative exercise than a lively party game.
