It is hard to write about induction without at least a brief mention of its close cousin, deduction. Whereas deduction comes from following rules to their logical conclusion, induction comes from observations. In other words, deduction is about analysis and induction is about pattern recognition.

While there are many deduction games that I enjoy, I have a soft spot for induction. Let's take a look at a few games that use inductive reasoning as a primary feature, and then circle back to why it's a fun mechanic.

## Mao

Growing up, I encountered the inductive game **Mao**, a folk game with endless variants. Like **Crazy Eights**, it is played with a standard deck of cards with the goal of getting rid of all your cards. However, new players are not told the rules. Instead, they learn through trial and error and observation, and breaking the rules typically results in the dealer giving a penalty card.

While I have had some fun times playing **Mao**, in my experience it can be frustrating for new players. Because the rules are often arbitrary and vary between groups, players may struggle to form meaningful hypotheses or feel punished for things they could not reasonably predict. Unlike some of the games discussed later, where hidden rules typically follow a consistent internal logic, **Mao** often relies on social memory and ritual, making the learning process more chaotic and less satisfying for players who prefer structured discovery.

## Eleusis & Eleusis Express

**Eleusis** is a card game designed by Robert Abbott in the 1950s to reflect the scientific method. One player, known as "God," creates a secret rule that governs which cards may be played, while the other players, acting as "scientists," attempt to discover the rule through induction. Players form hypotheses, test them by playing cards from their hands, and refine their theories based on whether their plays are accepted or rejected. A simplified version of the game called **Eleusis Express** was later introduced by John Golden to make gameplay faster and more accessible. I have more experience playing **Eleusis Express** than its big brother — mostly because I found the scoring system in **Eleusis** to be very fiddly and hard to teach. That said, it is impossible to deny the long shadow it has cast on the induction genre.

## Zendo

In **Zendo**, designed by the late Kory Heath, one player chooses a secret rule that governs the arrangement of the pieces, while the other players work to discover the rule. Players build structures and receive feedback on whether their creations follow the hidden rule, while gradually forming hypotheses about the rule. Although there certainly is shared heritage between the two, I believe that **Zendo** takes the innovation of **Eleusis** and streamlines it into an easy-to-teach and much smoother experience.

## Things in Rings

**Things in Rings** is a party-style induction game designed by Peter C. Hayward. One player, called the Knower, secretly assigns hidden categories to three overlapping rings, and the other players, called Finders, try to figure out the rules. Players place cards into the rings and receive feedback about whether their placements are correct, with the eventual aim of getting rid of all cards in their hand.

**Things in Rings** is the most playful of this group — even more so because of its Seussian artwork. As the number of cards in the diagram increases, you can often get a vibe for what is correct before putting your thumb on the exact rules. In some cases, however, you get an answer that challenges your gut reaction. Often, players can solve two or maybe only one of the categories, but have enough of a pulse on the rules to make correct guesses.

## What Makes it Fun?

These games highlight why inductive reasoning is so satisfying: they invite players to notice hidden patterns, form their own theories, and experience the thrill of discovery when their ideas are confirmed. Each guess or hypothesis is a small personal victory, driven by a feeling of agency rather than rote problem-solving. Whether you're trying to divine the unspoken rituals of **Mao**, uncover the secret laws of **Eleusis**, build structures that fit an unseen rule in **Zendo**, or decode overlapping categories in **Things in Rings**, the immediate feedback and constant tension between certainty and doubt keep players deeply engaged. These games transform uncertainty into excitement, rewarding careful observation, persistence, and intuition.
