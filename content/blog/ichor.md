**Ichor**, designed by Dr. Reiner Knizia, is an abstract strategy game that pits the Olympic Pantheon against the monsters of Greek mythology. Each player controls six characters—either gods or monsters—on a grid board. On your turn, you move one of your pieces, dropping the titular ichor tokens on each space you pass through, racing to be the first to place all of your tokens on the board. Each god and monster also has a unique, single-use ability that can turn the tide—but only if used at the right time!

There's a lot to love about **Ichor**, starting with its very solid foundation. It stands on the shoulders of **Clinch**, originally published in 1993. Take away the theme and player powers from **Ichor** and—voilà!—you have **Clinch.** And honestly, having played a few times using proxy pieces, **Clinch** is a strong abstract in its base form.

In the original **Clinch**, each player is focused on cornering their opponent's piece. Add in the powers for each god and monster and the game system blossoms, injecting a sense of dynamism into the board. Think you've got the Centaur cornered? In a burst of energy, it deftly trots diagonally through your blockade. What's that sound? The Siren's song lures Ares to her space before flooding the battlefield with ichor. The gods need not fear, though—Heracles arrives to pin Cerberus in place.

Okay, I might be overdoing it with the dramatic license—at its core, **Ichor** still is an abstract strategy—but the powers _do_ give it a tension that I rarely find in other games of the genre.

In addition to the excitement they add to the game, the god and monster powers also introduce something you don't often find in abstract strategies—randomized setup. The game comes with eight powers for each side, of which six are chosen randomly. This variability and asymmetry can lead to an unbalanced match, which the game fixes by simply having you play twice—once as gods, and once as monsters.

The **Reinforcements & Gates** expansion provides four more characters for each side, as well as a "Gates" module that changes the battlefield. The new characters introduce some twists, such as calling reinforcements and alternative paths to victory. The gates add tiles that trigger a powerful ability when passed through. Between the extra gate tiles and the potential for reinforcements, I feel like the expansion works best on the alternative 7x7 map—the 6x6 is already a knife fight in a phone booth, and the additional modules push it to the point of claustrophobia. Overall, while I appreciate the variety that **Reinforcements & Gates** adds, I don't think the expansion is necessary for most players: the base box provides a _lot_ of game on its own.

A review of **Ichor** would be incomplete without calling out the stunning artwork by Tyler Miles Lockett. The box art alone has more personality than many games on my shelf. The entire production—the cloth board, the standees, the power cards, and the tokens—has a premium feel, even in the base game. 

**Ichor** won't be for everyone. If you're not a fan of abstract strategies, it won't change your mind. If you're looking for a more _traditional_ abstract, you'd be better off with **Hive** or a game from the Project GIPF series. But if you're a fan of modern twists on abstract strategies—like **Onitama** or **Santorini**—**Ichor** stands toe-to-toe.
