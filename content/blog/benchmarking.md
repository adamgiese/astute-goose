_This post is the first of my **Interactivity In Games** series, where I explore different types of player interaction—from direct conflict to subtle influence—and how designers use these tools to shape gameplay experiences._

Even games dubbed "multiplayer solitaire" often have some light touches of interaction. One of the lightest is what I call benchmarking. **Benchmarking** is a form of interaction where you can merely observe the score or state of other players. While you aren't affecting each other, seeing how the other is doing can guide some of your decisions.

**Nintendo** leverages this in their **Mario Kart** time trials, where you have the option to play against a “ghost”—another racer that can’t affect you, but is always visible on the track. Its presence can still influence your behavior, though. If I’m behind, I might take shortcuts that could be risky. If I’m ahead, I’ll play more conservatively.

**Sausage Sizzle** uses this to its advantage with its eponymous sausages—a high-risk, high-reward mechanic. Unless you get a really lucky early roll, sausages are rarely a good strategy if you're trying to maximize your score. If you benchmark your opponent and notice you are behind, though, it might be the only chance you have.  

Some solo modes emulate benchmarking through target score thresholds. **Cascadia**, for example, includes a chart that ranks your performance across several tiers. The game doesn't react to your choices, but those milestones still shape your decisions—especially if you’re pushing to reach the next level.

Benchmarking may be one of the quietest forms of interaction, but it still shapes how we play. Whether you're chasing a ghost, eyeing an opponent’s score, or reaching for the next solo milestone, simply seeing progress can shift your decisions in meaningful ways.
