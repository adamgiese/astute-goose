*This post won’t go over the rules of **Skull.** You can view a copy of the rulebook [here](https://www.spacecowboys.fr/_files/ugd/59baa2_a7befd4787684a0d9adce3ed85f62ce5.pdf).*

Often on Reddit threads and BoardGameGeek GeekLists about games that can be played with a standard 52 card deck, I see the bluffing game **Skull** being brought up among the top options. Unfortunately, a “true” version of **Skull** can’t be played with a single deck of cards, since *without identical Roses, you can leak crucial information to other players.* 

Let me explain with an example. Let’s say that we are trying to play **Skull** with a standard deck of cards. For my Skull, I’ve got a Jack of Spades, and for my Roses, I have the 2, 3, and 4 of Hearts. Imagine the following turns. 

- On the first turn, you lose your Skull! Your cards are now completely safe to take from, but luckily nobody else knows it yet! You can still bluff.
- On the second turn, your 2 and 3 are revealed during another player's challenge. Everybody knows that you have a 2 and a 3, but they don’t know what your third card is yet.
- On the third turn, the 4 on the top of your stack is revealed. Everyone else knows that you have *all* Roses.

By contrast, let’s go through the same series of events, but playing with a Skull and three Roses. 

- On the first turn, you lose your Skull! Your cards are now completely safe to take from, but luckily nobody else knows it yet! You can still bluff.
- On the second turn, two Roses are revealed during another player's challenge. Everybody knows that you have at least two Roses — but they already knew that, so no new information was gained.
- On the third turn, a Rose on the top of your stack is revealed. Nobody knows if this is the same Rose that they saw the previous turn or not.

If you have a hankering for **Skull** and don’t have a commercial copy, luckily there are still options. As long as you have three identical cards of various types within a deck, you can borrow from *other* games to play **Skull.** If you’d rather have something more personal, you can print-and-play your own copy. Or, you can just ignore the information leakage and play with a standard deck anyways.
